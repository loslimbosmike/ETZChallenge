Communication protocol

Sender: ESP8266
Reciever: Arduino UNO

Maximum lenght of message: 32
End character: #

Communication rules
The ESP8266 will send a byte of data to the Arduino which will and with a # symbol.
The Arduino will send a ACK back if the message is recived correctly and a NACK if the message is to long.

Check for connection
The Arduino has a timer to check if there is still a connection with the ESP8266, therefore the Arduino will send out a SYN over the serial port.
If the Arduino does get an ACK back it will send back connected else the Arduino will send back connection lost.

Byte options

the last places of the byte will show which option is chosen.
